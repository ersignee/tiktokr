## üöÄ„ÉªSetup TikTokr

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ersignee/TikTokr/releases) Tab and download the latest .zip file
2. Extract the .zip archive
3. Press SHIFT+RIGHT-CLICK in the extracted folder and open CMD(it should open it by default in the script folder)
4. Install the required pip modules:
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
5. Run the script using:
   <pre>python tiktokr.py</pre>

## ‚è∏Ô∏è„ÉªDevelopement Stopped
TikTokr is currently not in developement and will probably remain such since I no more need this tool. It might get new releases in the future but if you still see this paragraph that means it probably isn't currently being updated.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è„ÉªUpcoming

The next release will have the following new features:
- Working Followers tab(?*)
- Proxy(?*)
- Rework of the interactive menu(?*)
- Auto Captcha Solver(?*)

?* = Not sure at the moment

Note that the followers and likes tabs in the menu already exist in the current release but aren't fully implemented yet.
